EffectorFam
===========

EffectorFAM is a database of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) designed specifically 
for identifying and predicting effector proteins that are translocated via the 
Type III Secretion System.

This web based tool allows users to submit protein or nucleotide sequences in
 FASTA format, which is then compared to the HMMs to generate a list of 
potential effectors.

If given nucleotide sequences EffectorFam will translate all ORFs longer then 
150 bp across all six reading frames. Note this may take a minute to calculate.
